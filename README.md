# Thomas-Algorithm
A C++ implementation of Thomas' Algorithm, where given a Matrix A and a vector R it finds c in the linear equation Ac=R and/or Ax=b.  This, however, solves the scenario when the Matrix A is circular in design.  Where the top right and bottom left part of the Matrix is filled, so that it is not a perfect tri-diagonal matrix 

The algorithm is via a link that is towards the bottom of the code in the comments.  There it will be more clear exactly what is happening.

# Testing
This code is still getting tested, as I am unsure if it will solve every time
